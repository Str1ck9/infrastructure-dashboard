## üß† High-Concept / Futuristic Themes

### 1. Cyberpunk Neural Network Theme (`/neural`)

**Aesthetic:** Blade Runner meets AI core.

**Design:**
- Animated neural links (canvas/WebGL) pulsing to represent data flow
- Service nodes rendered as glowing synapses connected by filaments
- Real-time "thought pulses" (ping animations when a service responds)

### 2. AI Command Core Theme (`/aicore`)

**Aesthetic:** 2050 supercomputer AI containment chamber.

**Design:**
- 3D rotating data orb (Three.js) representing total system awareness
- Voice I/O (speech-to-text for search, speech-synth for alerts)
- Biometric-style waveform showing server load
- Security level color codes (Alpha ‚Üí Omega)

**Keyboard:** T talk, A acknowledge alert, ? system status.

---

### 3. Quantum Control Room Theme (`/quantum`)

**Aesthetic:** Cryogenic quantum lab interface.

**Design:**
- Shader-based "quantum wave" background that ripples when data updates
- Services visualized as qubits entangled (lines flicker if connection fails)
- Hover reveals wave-function collapse animation + service entropy score
- Color palette: deep navy, cyan, magenta, silver

**Tech:** WebGL (Three.js/ShaderToy), matrix math for spin simulation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Industrial / Technical Realism Themes

### 4. NASA Mission Control Theme (`/mission`)

**Aesthetic:** 1960s‚Äì2020s NASA flight console hybrid.

**Design:**
- Split panels: Flight Director, Telemetry, Comms, Systems
- CRT flicker for legacy screens; crisp HUD for modern overlay
- Countdown timer, launch commit status, telemetry graphs (Chart.js)
- Headset audio static effect on alerts

**Keyboard:** L Launch sim, R Reset, / search.

---

### 5. Cyber Defense Center Theme (`/cyberdefense`)

**Aesthetic:** USCYBERCOM / SOC war room dashboard.

**Design:**
- World map with live-attack arcs (red for inbound, blue for outbound)
- Real-time pings simulated by random coordinates
- "Threat Level" meter and scrolling IDS log feed
- Quick-response buttons: Isolate Node, Deploy Patch, Trace

**Tech:** Mapbox GL or simple D3 projection; animated particle paths.

---

### 6. Data Center Rack View Theme (`/datacenter`)

**Aesthetic:** Photorealistic server racks with blinking LEDs.

**Design:**
- Each service is a rack unit (1U ‚Üí 4U) with LED state indicators
- Cooling fan animation and temperature sensors
- Rack power load gauge, PDU voltage graph
- "Walkthrough" camera (keyboard arrows to move rack to rack)

**Tech:** WebGL or CSS 3D transforms; sounds of fans & relays.

---

## üï∞Ô∏è Retro-Tech / Nostalgic

### 7. DOS Shell Theme (`/dos`)

**Aesthetic:** 1980s IBM PC terminal, color ANSI prompt.

**Design:**
- Boot animation with memory check and "AUTOEXEC.BAT" loading
- Commands: dir, run, ping, help
- 80x25 grid layout, block cursor
- Uses original DOS font bitmap (PxPlus IBM VGA9)

**Keyboard:** CLI input line; exit returns to main theme list.

---

### 8. Macintosh System 7 Theme (`/mac7`)

**Aesthetic:** 1992 MacOS Platinum UI.

**Design:**
- Classic window chrome with Chicago font
- Apple menu with About, Services, Finder
- Draggable icons with spring-loaded folders
- Balloon Help pop-ups with tooltips
- Boot chime when loading

**Tech:** Pure CSS mimic, 1-bit icon sprites.

---

## üß¨ Conceptual / Immersive Environments

### 9. BioLab Theme (`/biolab`)

**Aesthetic:** Containment facility monitoring lifeforms.

**Design:**
- Pulsing tubes (SVG morph) showing "organism" services
- Vital signs: O‚ÇÇ, temp, mutation index
- Alert color changes when a service "dies" (fails ping)
- Microscope view overlay with animated microbes

**Sound:** Bubbling, low hum.

**Keyboard:** A analyze specimen, / search, L lockdown.

---

### 10. Time Traveler's Console Theme (`/chronos`)

**Aesthetic:** Temporal navigation interface controlling time streams.

**Design:**
- Animated time vortex background
- Timeline slider; each service appears at a "temporal coordinate"
- Drag to different years ‚Üí loads archived stats (localStorage snapshots)
- UI elements: brass, glass, and glowing orrery rings

**Keyboard:** ‚Üê/‚Üí move timeline, T toggle time jump.

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Retro Tech)
1. DOS Shell - Similar complexity to C64, high nostalgia factor
2. Mac System 7 - Windows 3.1 already implemented, good complement

### Medium Priority (Industrial)
3. NASA Mission Control - Great visual appeal, Chart.js integration
4. Data Center Rack View - Realistic, industry-relevant
5. Cyber Defense Center - Security operations appeal

### Advanced Priority (High Concept)
6. Cyberpunk Neural - Requires WebGL expertise
7. Quantum Control Room - Complex shader programming
8. AI Command Core - Voice API integration needed

### Special Projects
9. BioLab - Unique concept, SVG animation focus
10. Time Traveler - Creative concept, localStorage time series

## Technical Considerations

- **WebGL/Three.js themes** will require additional dependencies
- **Voice API themes** need user permission handling
- **Retro themes** can use existing patterns from C64/BBS
- **Map-based themes** should consider Leaflet as lightweight alternative to Mapbox
- All themes should maintain responsive design and accessibility standards
